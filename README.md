# Music-Genre-Classification-using-CNN
## Description:
Music genre classification has become important in this rapid growing world. In order to have a good playlist based on the users interest many companies are doing extensive research in this field so to provide a better overall experience to the user. The main objective of this paper is to design a classifier which can detect the genre of the music clip provided as the test subject.Feature extraction is an important part of the design and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients is used as a feature vector. deep learning approach i.e. convolution neural network has been used in the design. A comparison between support vector machines using MATLAB and Convolution neural networks using python is done and tabulated at the end of the papers which shows that neural nets have dominance in accuracy and better prediction of the test data.
